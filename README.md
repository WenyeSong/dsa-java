# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects
This repository showcases projects completed during my Data Structures and Algorithms classes, all implemented in Java. Each folder contains an "XXXQuiz" class, and some contain "XXX HW" and "XXX HWExtra", which are the core algorithm part for each project entirely written by me. Other classes are provided by the instructor.
