# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects
This repository showcases projects completed during my Data Structures and Algorithms classes, all implemented in Java. Each folder contains a "XXXQuiz" class, which is the core algorithm part for each project entirely written by me. Other classes are provided by the instructor.
